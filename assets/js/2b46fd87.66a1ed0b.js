Though all good dragons payed homage to Bahamut, gold, silver, and brass dragons held him in particularly high regard.

In his natural form, Bahamut was a long, sinuous dragon covered in silver-white scales that sparkled and gleamed even in the dimmest light. Bahamut\u2019s catlike eyes were deep blue, as azure as a midsummer sky, some say. Others insist that Bahamut\u2019s eyes were a frosty indigo, like the heart of a glacier.
